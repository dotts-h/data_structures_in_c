# Data Structures in C

These are console apps created in the 2nd semester of my 1st year of Computer Science Graduate Shool.
They include: linked list, doubly linked list, stack, queue, binary search tree, expression evaluation via BST. Also these are created using dynamic memory allocation.
They are full blown console apps which allows guidance of the user via menus and stdout clear(refresh) which contain different features, depending on the data structure, like: generate ds, add, remove, delete, search, sort, traverse tree etc..
