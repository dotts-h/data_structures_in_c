# Data Structures in C

These are console apps created in the 2nd semester of my 1st year of Computer Science Graduate School.

They include: linked list, doubly linked list, stack, queue, binary search tree, expression evaluation via BST. Also, they are using dynamic memory allocation.

They are full blown console apps which allows interactivity via menus and stdout clear(refresh) and provide different features, depending on the data structure, like: generate ds, add, remove, delete, sort, traverse tree etc.
